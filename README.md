# ResponsivePortfolio

1. I imported all files from the school solution to Thursday's recommended homework as a starting point.
2. As with the bootstrapportfolio homework, I did not have aa good handle on how to create the "connect with me" element so I used an unordered list to act as a placeholder.  
3. I input media queries into the css at the 980-width, 768-width and 480-width points and tried to make the resulting changes look like the images provided for each page at each width. 
4. The contact form was very straightforward and responded well.
5. The index file similarly responded pretty well.  However, I did not succeed in displaying the text beside the photo in a manner that allowed text to wrap underneath the photo.  
6. The portfolio file was the most problematic.  I did not have a good understanding of how the placement of the images worked in the original file so could not manipulate it in the various width configurations.
